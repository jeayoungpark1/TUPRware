    "Explanation": 
      "This nodule is solid in composition (+2 points), very hypoechoic in echogenicity as it is darker than the adjacent strap muscles (+3 points), is taller-than-wide in shape (+3 points), has lobulated margins (+2 points) and contains punctate echogenic foci (+3 points). This nodule receives a total of 13 points, placing it in TI-RADS level 5 (7+ points, highly suspicious). TI-RADS recommends FNA for TR5 nodules beginning at 1.0 cm. This nodule measured 1.7 cm, so it qualifies for FNA."
